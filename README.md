# Deep Work Supervisor

Managing time is important because time is the most precious thing we have.

The Deep Work Supervisor is here to help you do more Deep Work by showing you what you have been doing.    

It provides improved reporting from the Be Focused Pro app.  


# Scripts

## Pre-processing  

Take BeFocused output .csv and tweak it to facilitate analysis and visualization.  

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Mine the data for interesting observations.  

Some ideas;  

- trend of total productive time vs available time  
- a total deep work 'score' 
- trend per category  
- forecast 12 month out with lagged performance
